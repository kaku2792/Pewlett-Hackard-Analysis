The company will need to hire or promote Engineers to a Senior Engineer position. They will have to hire around 7 times more people as Senior Engineers than any other department since the majority of people retiring are Senior Engineers. 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Yes there are 1,549 employees that are eligible for the program. If for some reason the people do not want to be a mentor, they can also extent their age range to have more people quilify, or ask people who may not qualify to prove they are able to be a mentor if they fill certain criteria.
